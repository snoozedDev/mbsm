Here's my epic contribution to the infrastructure discourse: IaaD (Infrastructure as a Document). It's a new paradigm for managing infrastructure that's based on the principles of Obsidian. It's a bit like IaC (Infrastructure as Code), but instead of writing code, you write documents. This allows you to leverage the power of Obsidian's graph view to visualize and manage your infrastructure. IaaD is the future of infrastructure management, and I'm excited to see where it goes.

No automation here, full of manual work and potential for human error, but whatever man I hate this kind of stuff.
