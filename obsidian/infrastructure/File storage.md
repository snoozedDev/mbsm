The CF Distribution is configured to go through cdn.mbsm.io using the CM Certificate and points to the S3 Bucket, delivering the files stored there.
File uploads are done via Presigned URLs, which are generated by the backend and sent to the frontend, which then uploads the file directly to the S3 Bucket.
